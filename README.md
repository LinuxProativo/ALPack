**ALPack**  is a tool developed in Rust designed to create and manage multiple
**Alpine Linux rootfs** environments in a practical and reproducible manner.

It leverages tools such as `proot` or `bubblewrap (bwrap)` for environment isolation.
Specifically engineered to be distributed as a `fully static binary`, ALPack operates
without dynamic dependencies on the host system. This makes it ideal for CI/CD pipelines,
developer workstations, and isolated environments.

While its primary purpose is to facilitate **static binary compilation** by generating a
complete rootfs ready for build workflows and package development, ALPack also supports
parameters for configuring minimal environments. This flexibility extends the tool's
utility to a wide range of use cases beyond its core build focus.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 Easily create and manage **portable Alpine rootfs**.

- ⚡ Fast and minimal Alpine Linux environment setup;

- 🧪 Safe sandboxing for testing or restricted systems;

- 📁 Support for multiple rootfs directories;

- 💪 Ideal for compiling static binaries using musl and Alpine's minimal toolchain.

- 🛠️ Work directly with **APKBUILDs**, simplifying the packaging process.

- 💼 Run anywhere without complex installation, thanks to its fully **portable design**.

- 🔒 Runs without real root;

Lightweight, fast, and productivity-focused, ALPack bridges the gap between Alpine
Linux flexibility and secure isolated environments.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
ALPack <parâmetro> [opções] [--] [ARGS...]
```

## ⚡ Basic Examples

Below is a practical workflow designed to be straightforward and reproducible.

### 1) Preparing the Rootfs Environment

Start by setting up a default environment. Use `--edge` if you intend to work with
APKBUILDs (highly recommended for Alpine-based builds).
```bash
$ ALPack setup --edge 
```

### 2) Running Commands Inside the Rootfs

Commands can be executed in multiple ways. Optionally, use `--` to distinguish ALPack
parameters from the guest commands. The `-c` parameter is also optional and helpful
in specific shell contexts.

```bash
$ ALPack run -- cat /etc/os-release$ ALPack run -c "cat /etc/os-release"
```

### 3) Mounting Source Code into the Rootfs

You can bind-mount your project directory from the host into the rootfs using
`--bind-args` as shown below:

```bash
$ ALPack run --b "--bind /home/user/project:/src" -c "cd /src && ./build.sh"
```

This is particularly useful when your project is located outside the standard
home directory.

### 4) Compiling with Static Linking Flags

Here are common examples for `C/C++` static builds:

```bash
# Force static linking for dependencies and the binary
PKG_CONFIG="pkg-config --static" \
CFLAGS="-static" \
LDFLAGS="-static" \
./configure --disable-shared --enable-static

# -all-static is optional but sometimes required for complex toolchains
make LDFLAGS="-all-static"
```

After compilation, verify if the binary is truly static:

```bash
$ ldd static-binary
## not a dynamic executable
## statically linked

$ file static-binary 
## ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked,... 
## ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), static-pie linked,...
```

## 📦 Optional Installation

You can install AlpineBox manually:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/LinuxDicasPro/ALPack/releases/download/Continuous/ALPack
$ chmod +x ./ALPack
$ sudo mv ./ALPack /usr/bin/ALPack
```

## 🧪 Why Use ALPack for Static Binary Compilation?

Compiling static binaries offers a significant advantage when you need to distribute
an executable that does not depend on the host's `libc` or other dynamic libraries.
ALPack streamlines this process because:

- 📌 It provides a **ready-to-use and predictable Alpine rootfs** for compilation,
or a minimal environment where you maintain full control over the build toolchain;

- 📌 It isolates the build from the host system, ensuring that compilation is performed
without cluttering the host or relying on local toolchains;

- 📌 **ALPack itself is distributed as a static binary**, simplifying the portability of the
tool across any environment without the need to install multiple dependencies;

- 📌 Alpine Linux includes the necessary static libraries required for `C/C++` to compile
fully static binaries.
